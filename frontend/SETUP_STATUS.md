Great! I'm setting up your React frontend now. I'll create:

## ✅ What I'm Building:

### 1. **Landing Page**
- Dark badminton-themed background (you'll provide the image)
- Smooth fade-in animations
- Feature cards explaining the system
- "Get Started" CTA button

### 2. **Dashboard**  
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Clean, minimal design
- All features:
  - View courts, equipment, coaches
  - Check availability
  - Calculate prices
  - Book courts
  - View/cancel bookings

### 3. **Complete Integration**
- Connected to your Django backend API
- JWT authentication
- Responsive design
- Modern UI with smooth transitions

I'm creating the structure now. Please provide the background image whenever you're ready, and I'll integrate it!
